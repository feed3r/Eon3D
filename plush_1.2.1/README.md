This is *NOT* the vanilla plush 1.2.0 source tree.
This is a snapshot of [my plush 1.2.x fork](http://github.com/mojaves/plush)
with very minor modifications. You can consult the git changelog
to see the details.

In order to plainly mark this is a derived version, I marked this
version as 1.2.1. 

A verbatim, not altered snapshot of the plush 1.2.0 source tree
is included to better understand the changes and modifications I made.

The code was fetched from the (last known) [plush homepage](http://www.1014.org/code/nullsoft/plush/)
