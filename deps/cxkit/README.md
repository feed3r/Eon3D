===============================

Overview
--------

cxkit is yet another collection of utilities for the C language.
You heard the same story over and over, but here it comes again:
cxkit is built bottom-up as a collection of modules and utilties
which I use over and over again in my open-source projects.
In the end they are consolidated in a single place, such as cxkit.

cxkit includes:
* memory allocation helpers (misallocation trace...).
* string function helpers (strip, split...).
* a minimal pluggable logging system.
* resizable array aka vector.
