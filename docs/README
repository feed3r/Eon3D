This is the eon3D documents collection.

The documentation gathered here is developer-oriented, ranging
fron topics such design decision, algorhytm selection, code
organization and stuff.

As already stated, eon3D is a learning project. Neverthless, minimal
knowledge of the 3D math/programming/jargon is assumed.
Wherever practical, reminders and links are provided.

The documentation is provided mostly, but not exclusively, as
simple text. You can distinguish the formats by the file extension:

Extension		Format		Readable as plain text?
----------------------------------------------------------------
none/.txt		plain text	yes
.md			markdown[1]	yes
